I'm currently on a gap semester from MIT! With the absence of PSETs has come a lot more mental space to learn more about and reflect on things I've previously pushed aside, like my values, non-academic interests, and how I want to live my life. As these thoughts accumulate, I've started to build the habit of writing them down as soon as I have them, rather than letting them dissipate into the void.

I want to use this blog to compile these raw thoughts into something more cohesive, so I can flesh out undeveloped ideas and better understand myself or concepts I've been learning. Hopefully, this will be something fun and insightful for future Hailey to look back on.

Looking forward to seeing where this goes!
